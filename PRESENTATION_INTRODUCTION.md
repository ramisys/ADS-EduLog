## 3. **Brief System Overview**

### What the system does:
- **Comprehensive Educational Management System** that streamlines:
  - Student attendance tracking (Present, Absent, Late)
  - Grade management with term-wise breakdown
  - Performance monitoring and analytics
  - Assessment management (Activities, Quizzes, Projects, Exams)
  - Real-time notifications for academic activities
  - Performance reports and analytics

### Target users:
- **Students**: Access personal dashboard to view grades, attendance, subjects, and receive notifications
- **Teachers**: Manage subjects, record attendance and grades, view student performance analytics, and send notifications
- **Parents**: Monitor children's academic progress, view grades and attendance for all children, and receive notifications about their children's academic activities
- **Administrators**: Full system access for user management and data administration

### Main problem addressed:
- **Inefficient manual processes** in educational institutions for tracking student attendance and grades
- **Lack of real-time access** to academic information for students, teachers, and parents
- **Fragmented communication** between stakeholders (students, teachers, parents)
- **Difficulty in monitoring student performance** and identifying at-risk students early
- **Time-consuming administrative tasks** for teachers in managing multiple classes and subjects
- **Limited visibility for parents** into their children's academic progress and attendance

**Solution**: EduLog provides a centralized, web-based platform with role-based dashboards that enable real-time access to academic information, automated notifications, comprehensive performance tracking, and streamlined administrative processes for all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem.
